#### This project was made as an entry for SOSC's Hacknight 2022. It won second place in Junior Level.

### Our solution is a website that uses pesudo machine learning to determine wheter any given infertile couple would benefit from the IVF treatment. Being a website, it is readily accessible throughout the world. It acts as a first resort where physically meeting an expert is not an option.
